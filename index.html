<img src="images/UFCsuperfight.jpg" class="center"/>

<p>Three titles will be on the line this weekend with four champions in action live from Las Vegas.
With three title fights atop the marquee and deep fight card featuring upwards to 15 bouts, Saturday's UFC 259 has the feel of a supercard.
Light heavyweight champion Jan Blachowicz headlines the pay-per-view from the UFC Apex in Las Vegas against reigning undefeated middleweight Israel Adesanya. Women's featherweight champion Amanda Nunes and batamweight titleholder Petr Yan will also make title defenses.</p>

<p> (-250)Adesanya (20-0) is a heavy favourite with an implied win probability of 71.45% despite (+195)Blachowicz (28-7) being the incumbent champ in the higher weight class. (-1100)Nunes (20-4) is the biggest betting favourite on the entire UFC 259 fight card with an implied win probability of 91.65% against (+700)Anderson (11-4). (-115)Petr Yan (15-1) is only a slight favourite while defending his title against (-105)Sterling (19-3). This is the cloest betting line on the card with Yan having an implied win probability of a modest 53.50%.       </p>

    <h1>Fred Vanvleet clocks in a career high of 54 points</h1>

  <p>VanVleet dunks in a franchise-record 54 points (17-23 FG, 11-14 3pt, 9-9 FT) to go with three rebounds, three steals and two assists playing 37 of 48 minutes Tuesday in the Raptors big win over the Magic. From the beginning, VanVleet was on the top of his game scoring 28 points in the first half alone. Fred was particularly on fire beyond the arc, with his 11three-pointers setting a new NBA record for an undrafted player. Making an impact, VanVleet made his presents known not just offensively, but defensively as well with his six steals and blocks, just one below his season high.</p>

  <p>It's easy to say that VanVleet will go down as one of the best Raptors in history. He loves to play on the big stage with all of Canada backing him up. Betting on himself paid off last November when he signed a four-year US $85million ($107,627,000 CND) contract, another record for an undrafted player.
